# LLM-Enhanced Academic Content Generation

## Overview
This research project explores the integration of **Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Fine-Tuning** with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy of AI-generated academic content. By combining structured prompts, external knowledge retrieval, and model adaptation, we aim to reduce hallucinations and enhance the reliability of generated content, particularly in mathematical problem-solving and educational contexts.

## Project Goals
- Develop a system that leverages **Prompt Engineering, RAG, and Fine-Tuning** for more accurate content generation
- Reduce hallucinations in AI-generated academic content, particularly in mathematics
- Create automated tools for generating accurate textbook summaries, study materials, and structured problem-solving explanations

## Technical Architecture
### Components
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
  - Based on Transformer architecture
  - Utilizes 4-bit quantization for efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA)
  - Fine-tuned using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to improve mathematical reasoning
  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Maintains a vector database (FAISS) to store and retrieve relevant mathematical documents
  - Uses MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) to ensure diverse and informative document retrieval
  - Incorporates retrieved context into the model’s input before generation

- **Prompt Engineering for Math Assistance**
  - Structures responses into five sections: Problem Analysis, Key Formulas, Solution Steps, Self-Check, and Final Answer
  - Implements a self-verification mechanism to re-evaluate solutions and correct errors if necessary
  - Uses contextual formatting to improve retrieval and logical structuring of answers

## Fine-Tuning the LLM
The model used is **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B**, loaded with 4-bit quantization for efficiency. Fine-tuning is achieved using LoRA, updating selected layers (q_proj and v_proj) to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy. The dataset consists of structured math problems and solutions, formatted in a conversational prompt style.

Key optimizations:
- **Gradient accumulation** to manage memory constraints
- **AdamW optimizer** for efficient fine-tuning
- **Dynamic padding** to ensure efficient tokenized inputs

This fine-tuning approach helps the model learn mathematical reasoning patterns while keeping computational requirements manageable.

## Current Progress
- Implemented **QLoRA fine-tuning** on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B for mathematical reasoning
- Integrated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance factual accuracy
- Developed **structured prompts** to improve response clarity and enforce logical reasoning
- Added **self-verification** to re-evaluate generated answers and correct mistakes

### Current Challenges
- Further optimizing retrieval mechanisms for mathematical documents
- Refining self-checking procedures for complex math problem-solving
- Expanding dataset coverage for diverse mathematical topics

## Why This Approach Works
- **QLoRA fine-tuning** allows efficient model adaptation while reducing hardware requirements.
- **Structured prompts** improve response clarity and enforce logical reasoning in math problem-solving.
- **RAG ensures factual accuracy** by retrieving real-world knowledge, preventing model hallucinations.
- **Self-verification** adds a critical validation step, increasing confidence in the model’s answers.

This combination of techniques creates a robust, specialized LLM that excels in mathematical problem-solving, providing reliable and well-structured responses.
